# Motivation

I created this repo because after getting the Wemos D1 Mini, I had some great plans for it, but no idea of how to actually start. 

I hope to export all my learnings along my journey of figuring out the Wemos D1 Mini, and more generally, the esp8266, platform.io and general microprocessor programming. 

# Structure Overview

The examples folder contains full code, but not usable without creating a project, installing the correct libs and pasting in the code.

The snippets folder contains md files that explain a particular concept or idea.

You'll probably want to start with the [Getting Started](./guide.md) file if you have no clue what to do now that you have a Wemos.

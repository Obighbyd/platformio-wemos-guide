This example comes from the platformIO examples located here: https://github.com/platformio/platformio-examples/tree/develop/espressif/esp8266-webserver

You don't need any other libraries to run this. You should be able to copy and paste the cpp to use it in your project.

This should print out the ip address on the serial port. And if the mdsn responder starts correctly, you should be able to use esp8266.local *or* the ip address to access it.
